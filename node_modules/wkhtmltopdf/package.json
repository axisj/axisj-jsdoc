  "readme": "node-wkhtmltopdf\n================\n\nA Node.js wrapper for the [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) command line tool.  As the name implies, \nit converts HTML documents to PDFs using WebKit.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar wkhtmltopdf = require('wkhtmltopdf');\n\n// URL\nwkhtmltopdf('http://google.com/', { pageSize: 'letter' })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('out.pdf'));\n  \n// HTML\nwkhtmltopdf('<h1>Test</h1><p>Hello world</p>')\n  .pipe(res);\n  \n// output to a file directly\nwkhtmltopdf('http://apple.com/', { output: 'out.pdf' });\n\n// Optional callback\nwkhtmltopdf('http://google.com/', { pageSize: 'letter' }, function (code, signal) {\n});\nwkhtmltopdf('http://google.com/', function (code, signal) {\n});\n```\n\n`wkhtmltopdf` is just a function, which you call with either a URL or an inline HTML string, and it returns\na stream that you can read from or pipe to wherever you like (e.g. a file, or an HTTP response).\n\nThere are [many options](http://madalgo.au.dk/~jakobt/wkhtmltoxdoc/wkhtmltopdf_0.10.0_rc2-doc.html) available to\nwkhtmltopdf.  All of the command line options are supported as documented on the page linked to above.  The\noptions are camelCased instead-of-dashed as in the command line tool.\n\nThere is also an `output` option that can be used to write the output directly to a filename, instead of returning\na stream.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, you need to install the wkhtmltopdf command line tool on your system.  The easiest way to do this is to\n[download](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list) a prebuilt version for your system.  There are \nvarious platform specific issues to worry about.  I've found that the 0.11 version of wkhtmltopdf produces PDFs\nwithout selectable text or clickable links on OS X, and some versions require an X server and others do not.\n\nFrom my experimentation, the best versions are as follows:\n\n* On OS X, I use [version 0.10](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/detail?name=wkhtmltopdf-OSX-0.10.0_rc2-static.tar.bz2&can=2&q=).\n* On Ubuntu, I use [version 0.9.9](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list) 32 or 64 bit from that page.  Don't try to use\nthe version installed via `apt-get` because it is missing features and requires and X server.  Follow \n[this guide](http://wingdspur.com/2012/12/installing-wkhtmltopdf-on-ubuntu/) to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies.\n\nAlthough those versions are somewhat old, they have worked the best for me.\n\nFinally, to install the node module, use `npm`:\n\n    npm install wkhtmltopdf\n    \nBe sure `wkhtmltopdf` is in your PATH when you're done installing.  If you don't want to do this for some reason, you can change\nthe `wkhtmltopdf.command` property to the path to the `wkhtmltopdf` command line tool.\n    \n## License\n\nMIT\n",
